# flask_db_gui
Resuming project once I get a better understanding of Flask and browser based applications. 

This program is a browser based app that adds students to a database. The app builds a database and allows 
manipulation of the students Objects.
To this point the app runs, adds a student, but I have to trouble shoot some bugs with the additional 
database implementation features.
